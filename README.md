# Kubernetes
# Why Use Kubernetes Instead of Docker?

## Understanding the Difference b/w Docker and K8s

Docker is a Container Platform, whereas Kubernetes is a Container Orchestration Platform. While Docker helps in creating and running containers, Kubernetes manages and automates container deployment, scaling, and operations at an advanced level.

In a Docker-only setup, we face limitations such as:
- Single host dependency
- No built-in auto-scaling
- No automatic healing of failed containers
- Lack of enterprise-level support

Kubernetes addresses these limitations, providing a more robust and scalable container management solution.

## Problems with Docker and How Kubernetes Solves Them

1. **Single Host Limitation & Storage Issues**
   - **Problem**: When running multiple containers on a single Docker host, storage limitations can arise. Additionally, if too many containers are started, it can lead to resource exhaustion, causing some containers to fail.
   - **Solution**: Kubernetes operates on a Master-Worker node architecture, allowing deployment across multiple nodes (clusters). This ensures load distribution and prevents storage issues, improving stability and scalability.

2. **Lack of Auto-Scaling**
   - **Problem**: Docker does not have a built-in mechanism to handle traffic surges dynamically. It requires manual intervention to scale up or down.
   - **Solution**: Kubernetes includes a Control Manager that uses ReplicaSets to manage scaling automatically based on demand. It ensures that the required number of container instances are running at all times, preventing overload issues.

3. **No Auto-Healing**
   - **Problem**: If a Docker container crashes or fails, it needs to be restarted or recreated manually, leading to downtime and operational inefficiencies.
   - **Solution**: Kubernetes provides self-healing capabilities. If a container fails, Kubernetes automatically restarts it, ensuring high availability without manual intervention.

4. **Lack of Enterprise-Level Support**
   - **Problem**: Docker alone lacks built-in enterprise-grade features such as advanced networking, security, and integration with cloud services.
   - **Solution**: Kubernetes supports enterprise-level deployments by integrating with cloud vendors like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud. It provides advanced networking, security, monitoring, and automation features tailored for large-scale applications.
